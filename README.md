## FAQ

### What is the difference between this and other Jellyfin app projects?

* This app (Jellyfin Player iOS) is a newer effort to create a media playback app in native Swift. It is a work in progress and currently only supports media playback.

* [Jellyfin Expo](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-expo) (also known as Jellyfin Mobile) is a web wrapper based on Expo with some native enhancements. It is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jellyfin-mobile/id1480192618?mt=8) for iPhone and iPad.

* [Jellyfin React Client](https://github.com/jellyfin-archive/jellyfin-react-client) is an early project to create a single multiplatform app based on React Native. This project has been archived as we have changed direction to utilize native web wrappers on most platforms.
